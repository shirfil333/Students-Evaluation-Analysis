## Description for View

Report titled "Analysis of the Evaluation Level" with the aim of providing a comprehensive, single-page view that features interactive charts based on assessment levels.

The report includes three filters: 
-Year, Assessment Type, and Gender, allowing for customized data exploration. 
It features a section of cards displaying totals such as female and male students, total students combined, number of teachers, total courses, and total schools.

-Scores are categorized by assessment levels ranging from Very Poor (below 70) to Very Good (above 129), with a color scale applied across the report for visual differentiation. 
This color scale changes only in transparency to contrast between background and text, adhering to specific score ranges.

-A key feature is the main chart showing the average score across the report, including current and previous values, as well as year-over-year percentage change.

-There's also a bar chart for deep diving into assessment levels by grade, featuring a color gradient. A donut chart represents participation by period or semester (excluding summer), with drill-down capabilities into specific months, visually enhanced by seasonal color gradients.
Additionally, the report offers a 100% stacked bar chart for student participation by municipality across different assessment levels, and a heatmap for monthly performance from September to June, representing the school year. Each value in the heatmap is encircled, differentiated by color according to its value.
There's also a box plot categorized by gender, with sizes based on scores, following the report's color palette, and a detailed tooltip including school, name, grade, and individual assessment scores plus the average. 

-On the right side, a school list functions as a filter for analyzing specific schools, complemented by a drill-through button for detailed score data across various dimensions. This button activates with selections from schools, municipalities, or months from the mentioned charts, including an info button detailing the report's structure.
